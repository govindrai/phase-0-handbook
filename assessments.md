#Assessments

In Week 7 of the course, you'll take a timed assessment that is used to determine whether you are ready to continue in the program. DBC is not a traditional school, and we do not give traditional tests -- our assessments are always open-book, open-note, and open-anything-else-you-can-think-of. Think of it as a timed solo challenge, because that's exactly what it is.

The assessment is not the only factor in the decision of whether to allow you to move on, but it is a major factor. (Other factors include feedback from your teacher, whether you are a positive cultural influence in your cohort, your learning style, and so on.)

The assessment is given as a Canvas quiz, and can be taken anytime during Week 7. You will receive a study guide and more detailed directions as the assessment approaches.

##Practice Assessments

To help you get used to the feeling of coding under pressure, we offer several practice assessments in weeks 0 through 6. While these are for practice, you are required to complete them, and your teacher will often look at them to see how you're doing and what you might need help with.

Like the real assessment, practice assessments are timed Canvas quizzes. You'll see a countdown timer displayed while taking the quiz.
