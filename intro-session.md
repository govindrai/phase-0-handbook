During your first week of Phase 0, you will have an introductory session with your Teacher. These sessions will be scheduled to last an hour and will all be held during the business hours in your Teacher's timezone. They are mandatory, so please make the necessary arrangements to attend a session.

The purpose of these sessions is to:

1. Introduce you to some of your cohort mates
2. Make sure you have access to all our systems
3. Review important guidelines, policies, and Phase 0 structure so you feel well acclimated to the program
4. Answer any questions you have about Phase 0 or Dev Bootcamp on site

Please note that you do NOT have to wait to start on the Week 1 material until you have your session.
