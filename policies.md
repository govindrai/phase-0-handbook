# Dev Bootcamp Core Policies

## The Three Agreements: Integrity, Kindness, and Whole Self

At Dev Bootcamp, three agreements guide the actions of everyone in the DBC community (staff, students, and alumni). We expect every person to do their best to uphold these values every day. If at any time you are not upholding any of these agreements, you will be asked to leave the program.

### The First Agreement: Integrity
In simplest form, this means being honest. One way to embody integrity is doing what you say you are going to do. We expect you to be in integrity by:
- Showing up on time
- Working through the curriculum each week
- Communicating with your accountability group on a weekly basis
- Reaching out to Phase 0 staff when you are struggling
- Pairing with others
- Asking for help
- Submitting and rating feedback
- Posting and responding to questions on the community
- Completing every part of the process outlined in each challenge

Part of being in integrity also means that if you fall out of integrity, for whatever reason, you own up to it.  Most of the time all it takes is an acknowledgment of being out of integrity and everybody can move on.

### The Second Agreement: Kindness
We also expect every person to be kind to one another. Kindness does not mean "nice;" they are actually not the same thing. Being kind does mean being friendly, generous, and considerate, but it does also means giving constructive, truthful feedback as long as it is <strong>A</strong>ctionable, <strong>S</strong>pecific, and <strong>K</strong>ind (ASK). This might also include a difficult, but necessary, conversation.

We expect everyone at DBC to show kindness by 

- Providing constant feedback to one another
- Listening to one another and making compromises when necessary
- Offering encouragement and support to one another

Last but not least, we expect you to be kind to yourself. You've taken a big risk and are making a big change. Be patient with yourself.

### The Third Agreement: Whole Self

We expect you to bring your intelligence, your focus, your creativity, and your personality into each challenge every day. If you are struggling, we expect you to ask others (people in your cohort, alumni, or staff) for help. If you find that you're holding some part of you back from this experience, we ask that you focus on being authentic with your pair, your cohort, and staff. DBC flourishes when all of us feel safe being authentic with each other.

This includes exposing your ignorance and being open to uncomfortable emotional and technical challenges at DBC.

We expect everyone to complete the assigned challenges, but we want to reinforce that it's not about completing the challenge if nothing is learned. The DBC experience is fundamentally about *learning*. We expect you to demonstrate effort and mastery of each learning outcome by completing the challenges.

## Code of Conduct

Dev Bootcamp is committed to creating and protecting an equal, inclusive, and empathetic educational community.

We treat everyone with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, age, sexual orientation, ability, appearance, race, spiritual practice, religious affiliation, or any other personal characteristic. We reject words, actions, or images that express transphobic, homophobic, sexist, or racist ideas. We understand that sexualized content does not belong in an educational or professional setting. We aspire to find the courage to give each other actionable, specific and kind feedback if we witness behavior that harms our learning community. We resolve conflicts with listening and discussion. We listen, openly and with acceptance, to the experiences of people from all backgrounds. We work to notice and correct for our unconscious biases. We will keep learning and improving on the human skills that are at the heart of our transformative educational experience.
