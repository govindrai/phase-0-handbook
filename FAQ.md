**Q: What are the hours at DBC?** <br>
**A:** Building and Core hours vary by location.

Core hours are the hours of instruction where students are required to be on site and teachers will be present.

In **Chicago**, core hours are 8:00am - 5:00pm, and lunch is from 11:30am - 1:00pm.

In **New York City** and **San Francisco**, core hours are from 9:00am - 6:00pm, and lunch is from 12:30pm - 2:00pm.

Building hours for New York City and San Francisco are 7:00am - 2:00am. Students are not allowed to be in the building outside of these hours.

In Chicago, the building is open 24/7, but students are not allowed to stay the night.

**Q: Is DBC closed on US federal holidays?**<br>
**A:** DBC only honors the following holidays that occur during phases: Thanksgiving, Independence Day (July 4), and New Year's Day. During those days, the staff has the day off, but the curriculum is still up and needs to be completed. Phase 0 staff honor the following additional holidays: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and the day after Thanksgiving.

**Q: I'm thinking of getting a new laptop. What are your suggestions?**<br>
**A:** We have a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13JGWKAjjdx7-0kpLCmBQN2i5C5xhlgnVflj6CuQrvMk/edit?usp=sharing) written by a former student with some info on laptops. This is not super official DBC policy or anything, but hopefully it helps.

**For many other questions**<br>
