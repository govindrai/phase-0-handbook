# Changing Cohorts or Withdrawing

## Repeating in Phase 0

If you are having a hard time working through the content, or if you don't do well on the timed assessment in Week 7, your teacher may decide you need to repeat. Repeating gives you a second chance to complete the challenges you struggled with or did not complete. Some students join the cohort immediately following their current cohort (repeating three weeks of material). Others join later cohorts, depending on the recommendation of their teacher.

You might also voluntarily choose to repeat. For this option, note that there is a $250 change fee, because your spot in your original cohort will go unfilled. (You should receive an invoice within 2 weeks of processing).

Either way, only one repeat is allowed. Students who need to repeat more than once will be asked to leave the program, unless there are extenuating circumstances.

If you are repeating:

* You will need to submit all work for the prior units again in your new course.
* You must re-do all GPS and Code Review challenges for the weeks you are repeating.

If repeating is an option you want to explore more, please message your teacher to discuss it.

## Deferring to a Later Cohort

If now is not a good time to attend Dev Bootcamp, you may opt to defer to a later cohort. Most of the time, this means moving to a cohort that has not started Phase 0 yet.

When you defer, you will be charged the $250 change fee to reserve a seat in a new cohort. Expect to receive an invoice within 2 weeks from your request. You will also start Phase 0 from the beginning.

## Taking Breaks

Phase 0 is a highly structured program and there are no opportunities to take breaks in Phase 0. If you are in Phase 0, we expect you to be in an active cohort. It is not possible to take a 3 week break between Week 6 and 7, for example.

## Withdrawing from Phase 0

If you have decided to leave the program, there are a few steps we ask you to take to do this.

**If you have not started Phase 0** yet, or are in the Week 0 module, please contact both <mailto:applications@devbootcamp.com> and <mailto:phase0@devbootcamp.com> to let us know of your decision. In the email, please include the address you would like any refund to be sent to as well as the name of the person you want the check written out to.

**If you are in Week 1 or later**, reach out to your teacher in the [Canvas inbox](https://devbootcamp.instructure.com) to let them know you would like to leave the program. They will assign a special survey to you that will need to be completed prior to finalizing the request. We will also meet with you to discuss your decision. After that, we will submit your request to our accounting department.

Please note: It may take up to three weeks to fully process a refund from the date it was requested.
