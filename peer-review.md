# Peer Review

## Purpose

Peer review is a huge component of Phase 0. You will be expected to review around 1-2 of your peers' challenges for several challenge each week. This is a great way to see how your peers are working through the challenges while also solidifying your own skills. You will be asked to complete the peer reviews the week after your work is due. For example, you will review week 1 assignments in week 2. This will give you the opportunity to further review concepts from the previous week while also practicing how to evaluate against a rubric and A.S.K. Feedback.

For a short tutorial on how to complete peer reviews, please watch this video.

## Expectations

Peer reviews are an important (and mandatory) part of Phase 0, so please be sure to go through each assignment from the previous week to see and complete your assigned reviews.

NOTE: Assignments turned in past the due date may not have reviewers assigned to it. Please submit your assignments by the deadline to get the most out of your Phase 0 experience!
