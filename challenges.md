#How Challenges Work

* Challenges are meant to be done in order.
* Keep track of how much time you spend on each challenge. You'll need to provide this information in weekly feedback survey at the end of each week. This will help us gauge whether we are giving the right amount of work each week.
* Each challenge has an idea of time in the description. We are using short, medium, and long (and some variations) to help you plan your week.
* Each week's work is released and due at a specific time. Challenges turned in after the due date may not be reviewed by your peers and you will lose valuable insight on your progress. You cannot move on to the next week without completing the previous week.
* Challenges are graded as complete/incomplete. Rubrics will be used to help determine where you are in your understanding of the learning outcomes but are not actual grades. 
* If you have more time, always visit a bonus challenge to get extra practice or go more in depth with the material. There is no such thing as being too prepared!
