# Office Hours

Office hours are a time that you can ask questions and bring issues to your teacher or a Phase 0 Guide. You can drop in at any time during the hour, but keep in mind questions will be answered in a first-come, first-served manner.

You can bring many issues and questions to Office Hours including, environment or computer setup, general coding questions, and you can also bring your code to the session and ask for help on it (as long as it's not a solo challenge). If your question is outside of the scope of Phase 0, please reserve your question until others have gotten help.

There are two different types of office hours in Phase 0.

- Teacher-led Office Hours (Business hours)
  - These office hours are available through [Canvas](https://devbootcamp.instructure.com). Look at the calendar to see when they are scheduled.
  - These sessions are exclusive to students in your cohort.
  - These sessions are offered during the business day (M-F) with a few exceptions depending on the teacher.

- Guide-led Office Hours (Outside of Business Hours)
  - View these office hours on the Phase 0 App in the [Office Hours](http://phase0.devbootcamp.com/office_hours) tab. You will be able to join the video call through the provided link when the event occurs.
  - These sessions are open to any student in Phase 0, so you will be in there with students in other cohorts
  - These sessions are offered after business hours and on weekends.

*If your guide misses the session, please email <mailto:phase0@devbootcamp.com>.
