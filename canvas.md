Canvas is the Learning Management System we use in Phase 0. You can access the Canvas site using your Dev Bootcamp login at [https://devbootcamp.instructure.com](https://devbootcamp.instructure.com). **You will not receive credentials to log in until the week prior to starting Phase 0.**

Canvas will be the portal to the various other applications we use in Phase 0 as well as the place to access the Curriculum.

## Introduction
Get acquainted with Canvas by watching this [demo video](https://vimeo.com/74677643). Please note, the Phase 0 courses use the new user interface, whereas this video shows the old interface. The functionality is the same, but you will need to navigate through your course by clicking on the top left icon with three horizontal bars to get from page to page.

## Account
Once you log in to Canvas, go to your "Account" page (it will be the icon with your name). Under "settings," set your timezone so everything is presented in a time that makes sense to you. Please add a picture to your profile and a short biography so your teachers and cohort-mates can get to know you a little better.

You also have the option of setting your notifications, so be sure to review the notification settings and update them as desired.

## Announcements
Please check out the "Announcements" in Canvas frequently, or have a notification to email you whenever an announcement is posted. There will be important things in there to help you!

## Modules
Phase 0 course content is organized by weeks, which are listed in "Modules." To see your course content, please navigate to the "Modules" tab by clicking on the top navigation button in your course. You will only be able to see modules that are available to you.

Each module item has certain requirements to move on to the next module. Some of them will require you to view the page, whereas others will require you to submit the assignment. Please be sure to complete all parts before trying to move on.

Each week's module is released on Monday at a time determined by your teacher, but most likely at 12:00am PST. Even if the module has been released, you will be unable to view it until you have completed finished all of the requirements in the prior week's module.

All module assignments are due at 10:00am PST the week after they have posted. It's important to get the week's work in on time. You may ask your teacher for an extension, but you may only get two extensions in Phase 0. You may not receive an extension during weeks 8 and 9 as we need to be sure you are ready to go on site. If work is not in on time, your teacher will automatically move you to the next cohort.

## People
To see all of your cohort-mates, TAs, and Teachers, click on the "People" tab. This will show you every person who is in your course.

## Grades
In the "Grades" tab you will be able to see whether your course material was marked as complete/incomplete or what score you received on your Guided Pairing Session, Code Review, or Quiz. This tab aims to help you see where you are in the course, not to give you an actual grade. We ultimately do not care about a final grade in Phase 0, we care about how you are progressing with the material.

## Chat
There is a chat feature in Canvas that your teacher may decide to enable. It is a live chatroom. You would need to be in the chatroom in order to see posts or interact with your cohort-mates. Some teachers create a Slack channel for this kind of communication instead.

## Conferences
Your teacher will post office hours as conferences, so this will be where you go when you want to attend office hours held by your teacher.

## Main page
When you first log in to Canvas you will see an activity page and todo list as well as recent feedback, so be sure to check that out as well. There is also a Calendar you can use to help you stay organized as well as an inbox where you can email your teacher or cohort-mates.


If you have any questions about how to use Canvas, please message your teacher using the Canvas Inbox or email <mailto:phase0@devbootcamp.com>.

## Problems with Canvas

### Logging in
Logging in to Canvas is handled at the DBC level. Sometimes you may get an error that says your log in failed. In this case, try to navigate to the same page again, and most of the time it will work.

If it still does not work, try logging into Canvas using an incognito window. If that fails, go to [https://identity.devbootcamp.com](https://identity.devbootcamp.com). If your login is successful there, open a new tab for [https://devbootcamp.instructure.com](https://identity.devbootcamp.com). You should be automatically signed in to Canvas that way.

If none of these options helped, please reach out to <mailto:support@devbootcamp.com> and cc <mailto:phase0@devbootcamp.com> for assistance.

### Accessing Course Content

For issues with accessing assignments, etc. contact your teacher using the Canvas Inbox first.

### Bugs in Canvas
If you have something you are sure is a bug in Canvas, please report it using the help button then "Report a problem." We will need to forward it to the Canvas help team to assist you.
