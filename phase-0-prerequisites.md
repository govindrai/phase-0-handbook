# Welcome to DBC!

We are so excited that you have decided to embark on this amazing, life-changing journey with us.

Before you can start Phase 0, you will need to complete a few administrative tasks as well as some personal preparation. Please go through each of these sections and complete each task. Don't worry, you'll have time to ask questions in your first week of Phase 0.

Here is a rough timeline of what you should expect between now and your Phase 0 start date:

- Go through each task in this document. Each must be complete before your start date.
- You will receive an email one week before your start date to get you set up in the Phase 0 systems. You will not have access prior to this date.
- One of the systems you receive access to is Canvas, located at [https://devbootcamp.instructure.com](https://devbootcamp.instructure.com). The Week 0 module contains some activities that check whether you have done these prerequisites as well as a few new tasks, such as setting up your computer developer environment.** Plan on spending about 10-20 hours on the Week 0 material.
- During the first week of Phase 0 you will have an Introductory Session with your teacher to make sure you are set up for Phase 0 and to give you a chance to ask questions. These sessions are only offered during business hours, Monday through Friday.

# Before Entering Phase 0

#### 0. Brief Introduction

During Phase 0, you can expect to spend about 15-25 hours a week (on average) on the requirements and challenges in the curriculum. While there is some flexibility in when you decide do these challenges during the week, this is still a very intense experience that needs to be given time and dedication. It is not a time to go on a trip or vacation -- especially if you will be away from the Internet. The curriculum is separated into weeks, and each week is due the Monday following its release. The program is not self-paced.

##### Work and Phase 0
Phase 0 is intense even though it is part-time. We encourage all students to continue working at least in a part-time capacity during Phase 0. This gives you additional financial stability -- it's expensive to take 10-16 weeks off for the on-site experience as well as time for job hunting. It also allows you to discover whether Dev Bootcamp is right for you with less pressure. If you find out web development isn't for you, it's important to have options.

You should be able to complete Phase 0 with a full-time job assuming your job does not require more than 40 hours per week. If you've never programmed before, expect yourself to be at the high end of the 25-hour average (and maybe even higher). This will get you prepared for the on site experience, which sometimes requires 10- to 12-hour days, seven days a week.


#### 1. Create Accounts
You will need to create each of these accounts prior to your start date.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)<br> You will share your GitHub account with prospective employers, so keep that in mind when you create your username.

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)<br> LinkedIn will be an important part of your career search once you graduate. If you have some of your information in there before you start Phase 0, it will be easier to cull during Career Week.

#### 2. Update your browser
We recommend using [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) in Phase 0. Please be sure you have the latest version of the browser.

#### 3. Read about [preventing repetitive strain injuries] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s4PtCBr1oBmhCgfA3nJ6YTT_dQMpQnflt9U-T3frzN0)

#### 4. Improve your typing speed
If your typing skills could use some work, improve your touch typing with  <a href = "http://typing.lk/" target="_blank">typing.lk</a>. 

Before entering Phase 0, you should be able to type at least 40 words per minute.

In Week 0, we'll ask you to read the course handbook. If you'd like, you can get started on it earlier: [Handbook Table of Contents](README.md)
